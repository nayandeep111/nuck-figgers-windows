## Why This Repo?

Let’s be real: I’d rather not be stuck with Windows, but here we are! Tried my hand at Ubuntu and Kali, but ```everything comes with a cost```. I enjoy a little *fafo* now and then, but sometimes that costs me precious time. So for now, Windows it is! 

This repo is my backup plan for when Windows inevitably decides to throw a tantrum. Here’s a collection of my must-have software/tools, so I won’t have to scramble or rely on my memory in the future.
